This building was completely remodelled 11 years ago, and the units were beautifully outfitted with functional kitchens, roomy bedrooms and walk-in closets, a full roomy bath with in-bath linen, and an open concept layout that allows for functional living. Harbour facing, this unit takes in the sunlight from morning to evening and with a large deck, provides 3-season living to enjoy watching the sailboats go gracefully down the infamous Halifax narrows. With a separate laundry, storage/pantry area, solid surface countertops, and separate eat-up peninsula, mornings will be easy to manage. With a separate dining area overlooking the harbour, dinner parties will be a joy with plenty of on-street parking for your guests. Come see why this affordable unit should be your new address.\nCourtesy of: Engel & Volkers\nData provided by: Nova Scotia Association of REALTORS� 68 Highfield Park Drive, Suite 112, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia B3A 0E4\nAll information displayed is believed to be accurate but is not guaranteed and should be independently verified.
